## String Sum Kata
Create a function that takes 2 integers in form of a string as an input, and outputs the sum (also as a string).\
You can expect numbers and an empty String. An empty string should be treated like a non-existent operand.

Example:\
sum("1", "2") -> "3"
sum("-2", "2") -> "0"
sum("2", "") -> "2"
